# QLM Pro Licensing Terms

Quick License Manager Professional is sold on a per-developer seat basis (developer refers to developers or administrators). You need to purchase 1 copy of Quick License Manager Professional for each developer/administrator system on which you install it. Each QLM Pro license is bound to a single computer/single user.&#x20;

For each purchased license, you can install a single copy of the Quick License Manager License Server on a single server, be it at your site or hosted at an ISP.&#x20;

You can distribute the Quick License Manager DLLs royalty-free as long as your product does not compete directly or indirectly with Quick License Manager. You can use your QLM licenses to protect **any number of applications**. There are no fees per license activation or per sale.

Example:

Your company develops 3 products. You have 10 developers working on the 3 products. 3 out of the 10 developers need to work with the Quick License Manager Professional API and install QLM Professional on their system. You should purchase 3 licenses of Quick License Manager Professional. In addition, each license you purchase entitles you to install the Quick License Manager License Server on 1 server for the purpose of generating keys.

Your support representative uses the Quick License Manager Professional Management Console to manage the keys issued by your Quick License Manager Professional server. You should purchase an additional license for the support representative.

Note: If QLM detects that the QLM API is invoked in the context of a debugger, it deems the user a developer and enforces its licensing.
