# QLM License Wizard cannot read a settings file when located on a mapped drive

If the QLM License Wizard settings file (xml file generated by the Protect Your Application wizard) is located on a mapped drive, and the QLM License Wizard is launched with elevated privileges, the wizard will not be able to access nor read the settings file.

This is due to an issue with Microsoft's UAC.
