# How to configure the QLM to send emails from the server

The QLM Portal, the QLM License Server, the QlmCustomerSite and QLM License Wizard can send emails via SMTP. These emails are sent from the License Server.

\
To configure the SMTP settings of the License Server, follow the steps below:

* From the QLM Management Console, go to the Manage Keys tab
* Click Sites and select your site
* Go to the Server Properties tab
* Expand the smtp section and set the all fields as requried
* Click Ok

**Troubleshooting**:

In case emails are not sent, it is likely that your SMTP settings are not correct. You can test your SMTP settings by following the steps described in this [article](https://support.soraco.co/hc/en-us/articles/206684353-How-to-use-SMTP-to-send-emails).
