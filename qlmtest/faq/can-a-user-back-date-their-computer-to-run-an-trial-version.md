# Can a user back date their computer to run an trial version?

QLM protects against back dating a computer.\
\
If a user back dates a computer, QLM detects that the system date was changed and prevents the software from running.

Additionally, with QLM Pro and Enterprise, if the end user system is online, you can enable license validation on the server which will, amongst other things, validate that the time of the client computer is synchronized with the time of the License Server.
