# How to cleanup an orphaned QLM installation

There are a couple tools that you can use to clean up an orphaned installation. The attached zip file contains both tools.

1\. msicleaner.exe - run the exe - If it lists the QLM installation, click Remove to remove it. If it does not list the QLM installation or the remove fails, try the other tool.

&#x20;

2\. msicuu2.exe - first install this tool - the actual tool is called Windows Installer Cleanup. After you install it, run the "Windows Installer Clean up" app. You will see a dialog like the one below. Locate Quick License Manage and click Remove.

If the above fails, you will need to resort to directly editing the registry to cleanup the installation.
