# License Wizard or Activation Form is displayed eventhough the license is activated

When using the QLM License Wizard or any of the QLM .NET User controls, you may encounter a situation where the wizard or the activation form keep getting displayed even though the license was successfully activated.

This situation can occur if there's a discrepancy between the LicenseValidator class and the wizard/activation control.

The LicenseValidator class has 2 constructors: one constructor that takes as input the XML settings file generated by the "Protect Your Application" wizard and another constructor that has hardcoded values for all the same settings. It is highly recommended to use the first constructor to ensure that the LicenseValidator settings are in sync with the QLM License Wizard settings.

The constructor of the LicenseValidator class typically defines the following important settings:

* Product ID (DefineProduct)
* Major Version (DefineProduct)
* Minor Version (DefineProduct)
* GUID (DefineProduct)
* PublicKey
* CommunicationEncryptionKey
* DefaultWebServiceUrl
* LicenseType
* StoreKeysLocation
* StoreKeysOptions

The QLM License Wizard and the QLM activation control have similar settings that must exactly match the settings in the LicenseValidator class.

If you are using the QLM .NET User controls, you must edit the properties of the control and make sure that the settings above match the ones defined in the LicenseValidator class.&#x20;

If you are using the QLM License Wizard standalone executable, you must make sure that the xml settings file generated by the "Protect Your Application" wizard has the same settings as the ones defined in the LicenseValidator class.&#x20;

Note that as of QLM 10.1, the LicenseValidator class has a new constructor that takes as input the xml settings file generated by the "Protect Your Application" wizard.&#x20;
