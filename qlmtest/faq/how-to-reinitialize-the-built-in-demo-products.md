# How to reinitialize the built-in Demo products

During the evaluation period, if you are connected to the QLM Demo License Server, you need to use the built-in Demo products.

If you have mistakenly modified or deleted the Demo products, you can restore them as follows:

* Launch the QLM Management Console
* Go to the Manage Keys tab
* Click Sites and select the Demo site (it should be the only one)
* Click “Download your product from the License Server”
* Click Ok
