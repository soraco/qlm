# Upgrading Product Properties

When you modify the definition of Product Properties by adding new properties, for example, you may want to upgrade existing license keys with the new Product Properties.

There are two possible ways to upgrade Product Properties of existing license keys:

* A mass update
* An update per license key
* When activating a newer version of the product

### Mass Update

To upgrade all license keys in the system with the latest definition of your Product Properties:

* Launch the QLM Management Console
* Go to the Manage Keys tab
* Click Sites and select your site
* Go to the Advanced tab
* Click Upgrade Product Properties.
