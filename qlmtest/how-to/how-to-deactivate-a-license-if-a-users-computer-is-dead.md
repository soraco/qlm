# How to deactivate a license if a user's computer is dead

If your customer's computer is no longer operation and you need to transfer the license to another system, you must deactivate the license from the "crashed" computer.

To do so:

* Launch the QLM Management Console
* Go to the Manage Keys tab
* Locate the customer's license and select it
* Click the "Release" button in the ribbon bar to deactivate the license

On the license is deactivated, the end user can activate it on a new system.

QLM keeps a record of all deactivated licenses. To view deactivated licenses, click the "search" drop down and select "Search History".
