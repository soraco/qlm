* A Facebook account that has the same email address as a QLM customer
* A Google account that has the same email address as a QLM customer

If the user that logs in is the primary or secondary contact of an organization, the user has access to all licenses associated with the organization. The user is also able to manage user accounts and modify the primary and secondary contact of the organization.

If the user that logs in is not the primary or secondary contact of an organization or does not belong to an organization, the user can manage all license keys associated with his/her email.
