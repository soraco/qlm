# Overview

The [QLM Self Help page](https://soraco.co/quick-license-manager/selfhelp/) is a web form that you can include on your web site to provide your customers with self help for managing their license keys. The QLM Self Help page allows your users to:

* Activate a license on behalf of a computer that is not connected to the internet
* Deactivate a license
* Get information about a license such as which computers have currently activated the license
* Send a registered customer their license keys by email

&#x20;The QLM Self-Help page is found in the QlmCustomerSite (formerly QlmAspLicenseSite) web application. For details about the QlmCustomerSite web application and installation instructions, refer to this [article](../qlm-license-server/qlmcustomersite-qlm-self-help.md).
