# QLM Unity3d Licensing Sample

QLM can protect Unity3d applications with licensing.

The attached sample is designed to protect a Unity3d app running on Windows.

To test the sample, extract the attached file then browse to Assets\Scenes and double click the Demo.unity scene.

The sample is configured to use the QLM built-in Demo product and will connect to our Demo License Server for activation.

If you build the sample, you must run the generated exe in Windowed mode.
