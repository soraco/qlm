# How to display your EULA in the QLM License Wizard

The QLM License Wizard can display your EULA to the end user and block the wizard until the user agrees to the EULA.

* Go to the Protect Your Application wizard
* On the "Customize the Look & Feel" page, set the following properties:
  * QlmEULA: Paste a copy of your EULA
  * QlmShowEULAPage: true
