* QLM IS NOW OFFICIALLY SUPPORTED ON WOOCOMMERCE
* YOU CAN FIND THE QLM WOOCOMMERCE PLUGIN IN THE WORDPRESS PLUGIN DIRECTORY

(just go to wordpress.org/plugins and search for "Quick License Manager")

&#x20;**You can find the latest documentation of the WooCommerce plugin** [**here**](https://support.soraco.co/hc/en-us/articles/207907363-How-to-integrate-QLM-with-WooCommerce)**.**

Thanks to the contribution of one of our customers, WooCommerce integration is non-officially supported.&#x20;

The plug-in for WooCommerce integration is already included in your QLM web service DLL.

You do need however to configure an ecommerce provider as follows:

* Start QLM and go to the Manage Keys tab
* Click "Commerce Providers"
* Click Add
  * Set the Name to: WooCommerce
  * Set the Class to: Qlmsvc.WooCommerce
  * Set the Dll to: QlmWebService.dll
  * Optionally set the other fields
  * Click Ok

Detailed instructions to configure WooCommerce were provided by our customer and are attached. Note that these details are in French.

Note that we at Soraco are not familiar with WooCommerce and as such cannot provide any support related to WooCommerce integration.
