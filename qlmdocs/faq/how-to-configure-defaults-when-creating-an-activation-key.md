# How to configure defaults when creating an Activation Key

When creating an activation key from the QLM Management Console, you can save your most common settings so that every time you create an activation key, these settings are automatically selected by default.

* Launch the QLM Management Console
* Go to the Manage Keys tab
* Click Create Activation Key
* On each tab, select the settings that you would like to configure as defaults
* Click the Save Defaults button
* Click Cancel

The next time you create an activation key, the defaults you selected will be automatically set.
