# Difference between the License Expiry Date and the Maintenance Plan Expiry Date

Each license that you create in QLM can have two expiry dates associated with it: a license expiry date and a maintenance plan expiry date.

The license expiry date specifies when the license expires. Once a license expires, a customer is typically not able to continue running your application.

The maintenance plan expiry date specifies when the maintenance plan expires. A maintenance plan is typically associated with permanent licenses to determine if a user is entitled to upgrade to a newer version of your application. Once a maintenance plan expires, a customer can continue running your application but is not able to upgrade to a version of your application that was released after the expiry date of the maintenance plan. For more details about the maintenance plan feature., please read [QLM Maintenance Plan.](qlm-maintenance-plan.md)

To extend the expiry date of a license in the QLM Management Console, locate the license in the Manage Keys tab and click Extend Expiry Date. You can select multiple licenses and extend their expiry date with a single click.
