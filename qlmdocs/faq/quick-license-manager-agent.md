# Quick License Manager Agent

The QLM Agent is a utility that runs in the background, in the Windows system tray.

The QLM Agent is responsible for performing scheduled tasks and backup jobs.&#x20;

By default, after QLM is installed, the QLM Agent is automatically configured to run when the user logs in. You can configure the startup options of the QLM Agent from the Manage Keys tab / Options / General as shown in the screenshot below.

You can also launch the QLM Agent from the QLM installation folder: C:\Program Files\Soraco\QuickLicenseMgr\QlmSysTray.exe

Note that in order to process scheduled tasks and backup jobs, the user must be logged in.
