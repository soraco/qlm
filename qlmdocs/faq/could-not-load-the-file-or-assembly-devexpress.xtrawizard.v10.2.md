# Could not load the file or assembly 'DevExpress.XtraWizard.v10.2

When opening a Windows Form in the Visual Studio IDE that contains the QlmLicenseWizard control, you may get the following error:

Could not load file or assembly 'DevExpress.XtraWizard.v10.2, Version=10.2.3.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=05b4ca1e2821d978' or one of its dependencies. The system cannot find the file specified.

To resolve this issue, close the form and reopen it.

If this does not help, try the following:

* Delete all binaries
* Close the form
* Close Visual Studio
* Open Visual Studio
* Open the Form
* If you get an error, close the Form
* Open the Form again
