# QLM License Wizard Try Button

What does the QLM License Wizard Try button do?

If you are using the QLM License Wizard as a .NET User Control, you have full control over what the button does. The button will  fire an event and you program the event to do any operation of your choice.

If you are using the QLM License Wizard standalone executable, the Try button simply closes the wizard.&#x20;

In both cases, the Try button is only displayed after the user activates a license and only if the license is a trial license.
