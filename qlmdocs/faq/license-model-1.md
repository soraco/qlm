# License Model

The QLM License Model field allows you to distinguish between 3 license models:

* Trial: set this license model for trial versions of your application. A trial license is expected to expiry after a given duration or on a specific date.&#x20;
* Subscription: set this license model for a purchased subscription of your application. A subscription license is expected to expiry after a given duration or on a specific date.&#x20;
* Permanent: set this license model for a purchased version of your application. A permanent (or perpetual) license is expected to never expire.

The License Model is typically used for logically grouping licenses. It is also used in the context of the following [Server Properties](https://support.soraco.co/hc/en-us/articles/207920563-Server-Properties):

* enforceMaxTrialsWhenActivating
* numberOfTrialLicensesAllowedPerClient
