# How to create a QlmLicense object in VB6 or VBA

In VB6 or VBA, you typically use the LicenseValidator class generated by the Protect Your Application wizard.

In some cases, you may need to access the underlying QlmLicense object since the LicenseValidator class does not expose all the methods of the QlmLicense class.

You can access the underlying QlmLicense object by calling the LicenseObject() method of the LicenseValidator class.

**Example:**

Dim license As Object\
Set license = lv.LicenseObject ()\
\
Dim userData as String\
Dim response as String\
userData = license.GetUserData("", activationKey, response)

&#x20;

If you need to create an uninitialized QlmLicense object, you can call the GetQlmLicense() method of the LicenseValidator class.&#x20;

**Example:**

Dim license As QlmLicense

Set license = lv.GetQlmLicense

license.DefineProduct (...)
