# License Key Types

Quick License Manager supports several different types of license keys:

* **Activation Key:** An activation key is a key used to activate a license. It does not enable your software. It just allows a user to activate the license and hence generate a Computer Key. Activation Keys are used for online/offline software activation. An activation key packs the following information: A product ID, major version, minor version, number of activations, features, expiry date, and expiry duration.
* **Computer Key:** A Computer Key is a license key that is bound to a specific computer by embedding and encrypting a unique identifier of the computer in the Computer Key. The benefit of a Computer Key is that it cannot be reused on other computers (unless they have the same unique identifier). The [QlmLicenseBinding](https://support.soraco.co/hc/en-us/articles/360001183583-QlmLicense-LicenseBinding) property allows you to define what unique identifier to bind the license to.  A Computer Key packs the same information as an Activation Key along with a unique computer identifier. A Computer Key is automatically generated by the License Server during the online activation process. Once a Computer Key is validated successfully, the user should be able to run your application.
* **Generic Keys:** Generic keys are not bound to a specific computer. The advantage of this type of key is that you can pre-generate a large set of keys and just distribute them to any customer. The disadvantage is that any user who gets access to a key is able to use that key on any computer. _Generic keys are not recommended and will no longer be supported in future releases._

**Typical online activation scenario:**

| <ul><li>A customer buys your software online. An Activation Key is automatically generated via our ecommerce integration and emailed to the customer.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| <ul><li>The customer installs your software and is prompted to enter an Activation Key. The customer copy/pastes the activation key received by email. Your application, using the QLM API, connects over the internet to your License Server providing the information required to create a Computer Key. The License Server creates the Computer Key and returns it to your application.</li></ul> |
| <ul><li>Your application then validates the returned Computer Key and stores it on the end user system.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| <ul><li>The next time your application starts up, it reads the stored Computer Key and validates it. If the Computer Key is valid, your application starts up.</li></ul>                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
