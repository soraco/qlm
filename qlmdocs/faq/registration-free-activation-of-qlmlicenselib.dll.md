# Registration-Free Activation of QlmLicenseLib.dll

If you are developing a C++ application, you can use the QLM library by registering the QlmLicenseLib.dll (or QlmLicenseLib.Net4.dll) using regasm.exe. The registration of the QLM DLL requires administrative privileges and is typically performed by your install since it runs with elevated privileges.

Alternatively, you can now use the registration-free activation of the QLM DLLs.&#x20;

The LicenseValidator.cpp class (automatically generated by the Protect Your Application wizard) already includes the code to perform the registration-free activation. To ensure you are using the proper version of the LicenseValidator class, look for ActivateActCtx in the LicenseValidator.cpp. If it is not found, you should upgrade to the latest version of QLM.

Registration-Free activation of the QLM DLLs relies on a manifest file called QlmLicenseLib.dll.manifest. This manifest file must be shipped with your application and should be located in the same folder as QlmLicenseLib.dll (or QlmLicenseLib.Net4.dll).

You can find a sample demonstrating registration-free activation of the QLM DLLs in the folder below:

C:\Users\Public\Documents\Quick License Manager\Samples\qlmpro\Windows\C++\QlmLicenseWizard\vc10

In the sample above, pay specific attention to Project Properties / Pre-Built Events.
