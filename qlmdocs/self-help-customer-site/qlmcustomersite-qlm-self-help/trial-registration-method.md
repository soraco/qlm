### QlmRegistration.asmx  <a href="#h_01hdm5wzxvd26qzx28grcvv5dk" id="h_01hdm5wzxvd26qzx28grcvv5dk"></a>

QlmRegistration.asmx is a web service method that takes user information from the command line, generates a trial key for a given product and emails it to the user.

Refer to this [article](https://support.soraco.co/hc/en-us/articles/211568803-How-to-hide-the-URL-arguments-of-the-QlmRegistrationForm-aspx-or-QlmRegistration-asmx-pages) for instructions to hide the URL arguments.

To have the QLM License Server send emails, you must have an SMTP server and configure QLM to use your SMTP Server. Refer to the "Configure the QLM License Server to send emails" section in this [article ](https://support.soraco.co/hc/en-us/articles/207894796-How-to-configure-QLM-to-send-mail-using-SMTP)for more details.

Example:

{% code overflow="wrap" %}
```
https://qlm3.net/qlmdemo/QlmCustomerSite/qlmregistration.asmx/Register?is_productid=1&is_majorversion=1&is_minorversion=0&is_expduration=10
```
{% endcode %}

&#x20;Contact information can be sent as URL arguments or as part of the POST data. When integrating with a third party, the web.config file _thirdPartyRegistrationFields_ setting defines the mapping between the incoming fields and the QLM fields. To enable third-party integration such as MailChimp, you must set the useThirdPartyRegistrationFields setting to true in the web.config file.

When invoking the QlmRegistration.asmx directly from your own site, you can use the following arguments in the URL to specify the customer's contact information:

<table data-full-width="false"><thead><tr><th>Argument</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Contact Information</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>is_fullname</td><td>Full name of the customer.</td></tr><tr><td>is_email</td><td>Email of the customer</td></tr><tr><td>is_phone</td><td>Telephone number of the customer.</td></tr><tr><td>is_company</td><td>Company name of the customer.</td></tr><tr><td>is_country</td><td>Country of the customer.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Additonal Properties</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>is_confirmationmessage</td><td>The message that is displayed to the user upon successful registration. Variables are allowed.</td></tr><tr><td>is_emailtemplate</td><td>Name of the email template to use when sending an email to the customer. Email templates can be created from the QLM Management Console / Manage Keys / Email Templates.</td></tr><tr><td>is_sendmail</td><td>By default, an email will be sent to the customer with the content of the is_emailtemplate. Set the is_sendmail argument to false to instruct QLM to not send an email.</td></tr></tbody></table>

**Registration Form Rules**

In addition, you can set the following properties in the QlmCustomerSite's web.config file to control the behaviour of the registration request. Note that as of QLM v10, most of these properties can be set from the [Server Properties](https://support.soraco.co/hc/en-us/articles/207920563-Server-Properties) tab in the QLM Management Console.
