# How to show new searches in the QLM Portal

Any search created in the QLM Management console can be uploaded to the QLM Portal.

To create a new search:

* Launch the QLM Management Console
* Go to the Manage Keys tab
* Click on the **search** drop down and select "edit searches".
* Click Add to create a new search and configure the search as needed.
* Click Ok
* On the ribbon bar, click User Groups
* Select the User Group that should have access to the new search
* Go to the Searches tab and check the searches that should be visible
* Click Ok

Now, you will need to upload the search to the server:

* In the Manage Keys tab, click Sites and select the appropriate License Server.
* In the Products panel, next to "Upload your products to the License Server", check the "Upload Searches" checkbox.
* Click "Upload your products to the License server".

Note that this operation will upload all your local products as well as the new searches. You should only do this if the local products are up-to-date.
