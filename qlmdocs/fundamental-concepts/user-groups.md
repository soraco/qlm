# User Groups

### Overview

A User Group serves multiple purposes in QLM:

* Associate licenses to a defined entity such as a Reseller or an internal team within your organization.&#x20;
* Define the privileges of QLM Portal users.

#### Associate licenses to a user group

To associate licenses to a user group such as a reseller, you must first define the user group and then associate licenses to the reseller.

To define a user group:

* Launch the QLM Management Console
* Go to the Manage Keys tab
* Click User Groups
* Click Add
  * Set the User Group ID (name of the user group)
  * Set the Email of the user group (optional)
  * Leave the default values for all other fields and click OK.

#### Define privileges of QLM Portal Users

If you want to allow a reseller to manage their own customers and license keys, you  must define a User Account for the reseller and associate the User Account to a User Group. You define privileges of the user account at the user group level. For more details about this topic, [click here](../qlm-portal/role-based-access-control-rbac.md).
