# QLM Express Licensing Terms

Quick License Manager Express is sold on a per-developer seat basis (developer refers to developers or administrators). You need to purchase 1 copy of Quick License Manager Express for each system on which you install it. Each QLM Express license is bound to a single computer/single user.&#x20;

You can distribute the Quick License Manager DLLs **royalty-free** as long as your product does not compete directly or indirectly with Quick License Manager.&#x20;

You can use your Quick License Manager Express license to protect **any number of applications**. There are no fees per license activation or per sale.&#x20;

If you install the Quick License Manager DLL on a server for the purpose of generating or activating keys, you need to purchase an additional license for the server.

Example:

Your company develops 3 products. You have 10 developers working on the 3 products. 3 out of the 10 developers need to work with the Quick License Manager API and install Quick License Manager Express on their system. You should purchase 3 licenses of Quick License Manager Express.

You install Quick License Manager Express or the Quick License Manager DLLs on a system for the purpose of generating keys. You should purchase an additional license for that system.

Your support representative uses the Quick License Manager Express user interface to generate and validate license keys. You should purchase an additional license for the support representative.

&#x20;Note: If QLM detects that the QLM API is invoked in the context of a debugger, it deems the user a developer and enforces its licensing.
