The QLM Mobile App can execute two types of searches: Custom Searches that you defined in the QLM Management Console and ad hoc searches defined in the QLM Mobile App.

To perform Custom Searches, click the Custom Searches button, then select any search of your choice. You can add a shortcut to any search to the dasboard by checking the _Add to dashboard_ checkbox.

To perform ad hoc searches, click Manual Search, enter your search criteria and click _Search_.
