# Login Page

Once the mobile app is configured to connect to your QLM License Server, you will be presented with a login page to login to the QLM License Server.

The login credentials can be configured in the QLM Management Console / Manage Keys / User Accounts.

Note that a QLM Portal license and QLM Portal Users Licenses are required to create user accounts. User accounts of type 'Customer' cannot use the QLM Mobile App.
