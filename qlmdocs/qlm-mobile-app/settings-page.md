### License Server Configuration

To connect your QLM Mobile App to your QLM License Server, you must configure the URL to the QLM License Server as well at the encryption keys used to communicate with the License Server.

To do so, access the settings page and set the corresponding fields.

To simplify this configuration process, the QLM Management Console can generate a QR code which can be scanned by your phone to automatically enter the License Server settings.

To generate the QR code in the QLM Management Console:

* Go to the Manage Keys tab
* Click User Accounts
* Click Generate QR Code
* Copy the QR code to the clipboard and send it by email to the user of your choice.



The user would then simply launch the QLM Mobile App, click Settings then Retrieve Settings from QR code. This will configure the app to connect to your License Server.
