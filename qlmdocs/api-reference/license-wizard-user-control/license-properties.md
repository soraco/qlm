| QlmEnableSoapExtension           | By default, QLM sends custom headers with every SOAP request and sends information to the server related to the customer's locale. If this interferes with your own SOAP extension, you can turn off QLM's extension.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| QlmOfflinePeriodExceededAction   | Enable a timer that runs once per day and checks the maxDaysOffline property. If the timer detects that the maxDaysOffline was exceeded, it will trigger the selected action. You should enable the ThrowException option only if your code can handle exceptions. If you do not handle the exception, the application will crash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
