| QlmOfflinePeriodExceededAction      | Enable a timer that runs once per day and checks the maxDaysOffline property. If the timer detects that the maxDaysOffline was exceeded, it will trigger the selected action. You should enable the ThrowException option only if your code can handle exceptions. If you do not handle the exception, the application will crash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
