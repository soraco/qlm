# QLM Portal

The QLM Portal is an add-on to QLM. It provides a web-based user interface for managing license keys. The QLM Portal exposes the most common operations an administrator or a reseller requires to manage their customersâ€™ license keys. It requires user authentication and uses role-based access control. The QLM Portal is a perfect tool for your resellers or affiliates to manage their customers while keeping you, the vendor, in total control. You can specify how many license keys a reseller can generate, which products they have access to, and what operations they can perform.&#x20;

Through a role-based access model, you control the privileges of a user or group of users. Some of the license key limits that can be set are:&#x20;

* Maximum number of trial keys per system.&#x20;
* Maximum number of permanent keys per system.
* Maximum total keys. Maximum activations per key

In addition, you can control which of the following operations a user is allowed to perform:&#x20;

* Creating new keys.&#x20;
* Activating keys.&#x20;
* Releasing keys.&#x20;
* Deleting keys.&#x20;
* Creating customers.&#x20;
* Deleting customers.&#x20;
* Exporting keys.&#x20;
* Setting the Expiry Duration of a new key.&#x20;
* Setting the Expiry Date of a new key.&#x20;
