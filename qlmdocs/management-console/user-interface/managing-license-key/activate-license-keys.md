# Activate License Keys

The Activate button manually activates the selected license. Note that activation typically occurs from within your application via the QLM API. Manual activation through the QLM Console is required in a situation where the end-user cannot activate a license due to the lack of an internet connection. This is typically referred to as Manual Activation v/s Online Activation.\
