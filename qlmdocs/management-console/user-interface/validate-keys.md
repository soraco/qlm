# Validate Keys

The Validate Keys area of the QLM Management Console allows you to interactively test a key to determine whether it is valid.

To validate a license key, paste it into the License Key text field and click Validate a license key.

If the license is valid, the information contained in the key is decrypted and displayed in the form.

IMPORTANT: For computer-bound license keys, you need to enter the Computer Identifier field before validating the license. QLM cannot validate a computer-bound license key without the Computer Identifier.
