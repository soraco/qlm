# Get Started

### Dashboard

The Metro-style tiles that make up the Dashboard are organized by default into three columns. A row in any column contains either one full-width or two half-width tiles. (If the window height is sufficiently reduced, doubled columns or tripled columns may be seen.) The organization of the Dashboard can be customized by dragging individual tiles from one column to another, or into an empty location to create a new column. As you drag a tile to locations in other columns, the tiles already there move aside as necessary to indicate where the new arrival will lodge. The default layout of Dashboard tiles is in three columns.

#### System Information

The four smaller tiles in the left-hand column of the default layout show vital statistics from the QLM database, with counts of customers, total orders, today’s orders, and recent orders. (See Manage Keys  Options to review or adjust the meaning of ‘recent’.) The bottom tile displays news items about QLM. Click an item to view the full story in your web browser.

#### QLM Information

The tiles in the center column provide information about the latest QLM version as well as News Releases about QLM. The Refresh tile resynchronizes the Dashboard display with the QLM database.

#### License Information

The tiles in the right-hand column of the default Dashboard layout show information about your QLM license. The upper box gives a verbal status report regarding the license. The one beneath it lists the computers on which you are registered to run QLM. In the bottom row are displayed the number of licenses you have available, and the number of those already in use.

### Get Started Wizard

The Getting Started Wizard helps you find the best path into QLM for a particular licensing scenario by leading you through a questionnaire to determine three requirements:

**Programming language:** .NET 2.0 and higher languages are directly supported by QLM, as are Visual Basic 6.0, C++, Excel, and Access. Other languages can also make use of the QLM API if they are capable of interfacing with .NET assemblies, COM objects (ActiveX), or native DLLs.

**Application type:** The wizard offers “Standalone Windows application”, “Web App”, and “Windows Service” as configured choices. If your application does not fall into one of these categories (“Other”), contact us for advice specific to your situation.

**License model:** Your answer to this question determines the edition of QLM that you will need for your application. For instance, if you select “Simple license validation” as your license model, the wizard will recommend QLM Express as best meeting your needs. The wizard then provides a page of links to relevant tutorials and code samples that will help get you started without wasted effort.
