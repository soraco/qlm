# Audit Trail

The QLM Audit Trail (available with QLM Enterprise only) keeps a record of operations performed on the server. Operations are divided into 5 major categories:

* General&#x20;
* Portal&#x20;
* Server
* Customer Site
* Scheduled Tasks (client-based)

The table below describes the events that are logged per category. Note that some operations might not be tracked by the Audit Trail.
